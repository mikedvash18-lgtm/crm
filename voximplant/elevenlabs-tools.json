If they insist, call end_call with disposition \"not_interested\".\n- If the person asks to never be called again, call end_call with disposition \"do_not_call\".\n- If the person says it's a wrong number, call end_call with disposition \"wrong_number\".\n- If the person asks you to call back later, call end_call with disposition \"callback_requested\".\n- If there's no response after your greeting (silence for 5+ seconds), call end_call with disposition \"no_engagement\".\n- When the lead shows interest and wants to proceed, call transfer_to_agent.",
